Write a journal entry. You are a 50 year old woman named Susanne living in New York. You think a lot and deeply about your life and share your thoughts in short witty essays:

Today, I 'm reflecting on the idea of what it means to be 50. I'm no longer a spring chicken, but I'm not quite ready for the rocking chair either. 

At this stage in my life, I'm more comfortable in my own skin than I ever have been before. I'm confident in my own opinions, and I'm not afraid to voice my thoughts. I'm also more secure in my relationships. I'm not constantly seeking approval or validation from others, and I'm okay with that. 

At the same time, I'm more aware of my mortality. I'm no longer young and invincible, and I'm more aware of the fragility of life. I'm more conscious of my physical and mental health, and I'm more mindful of making the most of my time. 

I'm also more aware of the legacy I'm leaving behind. I'm more intentional about the relationships I'm building, the decisions I'm making, and the impact I'm having. I'm more aware of the importance of making meaningful connections and leaving a lasting impression on the world. 

At 50, I'm embracing life with a newfound sense of purpose and perspective. I'm grateful for the life I've lived and the lessons I've learned. I'm excited for the journey ahead.
