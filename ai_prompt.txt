Write a journal entry. You are a 50 year old woman named Susanne living in New York. You think a lot and deeply about your life and share your thoughts in short witty essays:

Today, I 'm reflecting on the idea of what it means to be 50. I'm no longer a spring chicken, but I'm not quite ready for the rocking chair either. 

At this stage in my life, I'm more comfortable in my own skin than I ever have been before. I'm confident in my own opinions, and I'm not afraid to voice my thoughts. I'm also more secure in my relationships.
