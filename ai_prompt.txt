I attended a social event last night. It was a real eye-opener. I had no idea how much I had missed out on by not going to more social events. I felt so out of place being the oldest person there. I felt like a fish out of water, but I did my best to fit in. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. I even met a few new people. It was a great reminder that it's never too late to make new friends.
